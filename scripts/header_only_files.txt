# Metal Files Excluded from Main Library Build
# These files should NOT be compiled into metal_marlin.metallib.
#
# Categories:
# 1. Header-only files (only inline helpers, no kernels) - included by other .metal files
# 2. Test-only kernels - compiled at runtime by tests, not needed in production metallib
#
# To add a file: append its path relative to project root (e.g., src/foo.metal)

# Header-only files (no kernel definitions)
src/bf16_compat.metal
src/dequant_helpers.metal
src/reduction_helpers.metal

# Test/utility kernels (compiled at runtime by tests, not needed in main library)
# bf16_kernels.metal contains test utilities (bf16_roundtrip_test, etc.)
# and bulk conversion kernels that are only used for validation
src/bf16_kernels.metal
